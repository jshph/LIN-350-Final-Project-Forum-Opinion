Research questions spelled out:    4/5

Most of the questions you pose seem to be "is this doable" -- those
are not research questions.

Method:    24/30

LSA works on top of bag-of-words representations of text. This loses
structure, so it loses information about which sentiment is expressed
about which feature of a product.

You need some sort of representation that keeps either word sequence
or syntactic structure, and you need to find patterns in word
sequences or in dependency structure that reliably identify sentiment
pertaining to particular items. Then you need to somehow learn what
features a particular type of product has, either by specifying this
manually or through pattern-based learning. 

Your example of "the sound quality is great" is indeed a judgment on a
feature, but this has nothing to do with selectional preferences that
predicates impose on their arguments.

Data:       17/20

You have put thought into domains that you might work on. but
assembling and annotating a corpus yourselves is a huge task. Search
the web for "feature-based sentiment analysis corpus". There are many
people who work on this task, so there will be datasets. Check for
example https://www.w3.org/community/sentiment/wiki/Datasets
