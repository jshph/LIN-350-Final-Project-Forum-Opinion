### From "Extracting Product Features and Opinions from Reviews" by Popescu and Etzioni

* 3.3.1 describes that there are problems with using windows of size K and a noun phrase chunker, much like the approaches we attempt to do. Instead, their tool uses rules (subject, object, predicate) to identify potential opinion phrases. NLTK does not provide built-in tools for this, called Information Extraction. However, maybe it is possible to write syntactic rules to compose those those rules.
