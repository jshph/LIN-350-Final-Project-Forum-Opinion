HOTEL#GENERAL 
Good service but rude desk clerk
SERVICE#GENERAL 
Oct.7, 2006 I arrived at the hotel and went to the front desk to check in.

The desk clerk was checking my information in the computer and I asked her if there were any suites available as I had called the hotel a week before my arrival and and was assured that I could upgrade to a suite.

She immediately began to yell that if I wanted an upgrade I would have to pay for it.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
When I went to my room, I took the AAA Tour Book back to the desk and showed her where it specifically stated that the reservation could be upgraded if a suite was available and it would be free of charge.

The same desk clerk started to yell again stating that she had told me when I called that I could upgrade for a charge and that was her rules.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
In fact I had spoken to a gentleman when I had called the week before, I never spoke to a lady.

I asked her why she was raising her voice and if this was the way she spoke to guests.

She completely ignored me and just kept on yelling.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
I asked to speak to the manager and she told me she was the manager when in fact the manager's name was clearly displayed on the wall.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
She walked away from the desk and the manager came to assist me about 10 mins later.

This incident was very humiliating as other guests were present.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
I am writing this review because this kind of behavior was totally unacceptable and hopefully no other guests will be treated in this manner.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
Overall service was great and the staff as a whole were very courteous and helpful.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
Not bad for one night
HOTEL#GENERAL 
Stayed on a Sunday night.

Front desk staff were friendly and helpful both with early check-in and an early check-out.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
Room was large and spacious, but rather bland.
ROOMS#DESIGN_FEATURES 
Excellent for a business traveler, or for a stayover with early departure to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, took 8 minutes to get to the airport via 10 freeway.
HOTEL#MISCELLANEOUS 
Ideal location.
LOCATION#GENERAL 
Very affordable rate at low $50s.
HOTEL#PRICES 
The pool looked nice, as did their restaurant, but didn't try either one.
FACILITIES#GENERAL 
Well below average
HOTEL#GENERAL 
I was looking for an above-average traveler's hotel for a one-night stay.

Unfortunately, this is below average.
HOTEL#GENERAL 
Rooms are large but very plain, with furnishings and fixtures as cheap as possible.
ROOMS#DESIGN_FEATURES 
The hotel shows its age and badly needs refurbishing.
HOTEL#QUALITY 
Bathroom sink was on a slight slant because it was pulling out of the wall.
ROOMS#QUALITY 
Nothing is especially terrible or unacceptable about this hotel.
HOTEL#GENERAL 
It is just subpar.
HOTEL#GENERAL 
Don't do it!!
HOTEL#GENERAL 
This place is run down, dirty and loud.

The pictures they provide on the web do not tell the story so don't be fooled.

Very clean, great service - they gave me a complimentary bottle of wine because I missed the hotel shuttle.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
Good restaurant and bar attached.
FACILITIES#GENERAL 
Close to Scottsdale and the University.
LOCATION#GENERAL 
I will never diss Paris Hilton again !

Price was right
HOTEL#PRICES 
Pleasantly surprised at $69 night.
HOTEL#PRICES 
Front desk was not helpful, but who cares...for $69 you get a clean, fairly-large room, central air, refrig/micro, free (but sparse) breakfast buffet.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
Stayed there because it was near Banner Hospital.
LOCATION#GENERAL 
Friendly Staff
SERVICE#GENERAL 
We stayed here at the beginning and end of a trip to Arizona so we were here during two differernt weekends.

The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
I would say they are the best part of the hotel!
SERVICE#GENERAL 
An elevator was broken during our last stay and it was most annoying, but did not greatly impact the overall experience.
FACILITIES#QUALITY 
We found the place quiet, the complimentary breakfast a notch above some others at similar chain hotels, and the parking adequate.

All in all it is a nice and affordable spot for sightseeing in the area.
HOTEL#GENERAL 
Administrative Issues
SERVICE#GENERAL 
The Best Western Executive Park Hotel is an average place to stay (though a bit far from downtown) with a substandard management team.
HOTEL#GENERAL 
I've tried to obtain a receipt for my stay to replace one I lost and have been ignored.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
There's never anyone to talk to from management and phone calls/e mails receive no response.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
It's not a recipe for another stay.
HOTEL#GENERAL 
Not impressed
HOTEL#GENERAL 
The desk person was in a rude mood.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
There was construction being done on the street in front of the hotel; which made it very difficult driving around.
HOTEL#MISCELLANEOUS 
The air conditioner was very loud.
ROOMS_AMENITIES#QUALITY 
Nothing told us that there was a free breakfast - the restaurant looked like it was closed.

I got a great deal of 120 USD for 2 nights from priceline.

I really liked the hotel, it was very clean, the staff were fantastic and the rooms were great.
HOTEL#GENERAL 
I cant complain about this hotel stay.
HOTEL#GENERAL 
the location is in the central valley so getting to anywhere is easy with the easy access to the local freeways.
LOCATION#GENERAL 
the only drawback was that the pool area this time of year didnt seem to get much sun during the day, but the water is heated so it didnt matter too much.
FACILITIES#DESIGN_FEATURES 
I would absolutely stay here again!!
HOTEL#GENERAL 
I didn't expect much, but...

I was pleasantly surprised.
HOTEL#GENERAL 
My flight was delayed so I was put up in this hotel.

I expected it to be a dingy motel, but to my surprise, the rooms were clean and even a little spacious.
ROOMS#CLEANLINESS 
Obviously it wasn't the Ritz Carlton, but I can't say how relieving it is to come to a clean, comfortable room after a ten hour stay in an airport terminal.

The continental breakfast was excellent.
FOOD_DRINKS#QUALITY 
If all you want is a clean place to stay without the frills, and especially if you're a business traveler, stay here.

They seem to have businesspeople in mind.

This was my third stay in two months and I have noticed a continuing trend of upgrades and service.
HOTEL#GENERAL 
Understand the property is under new management and it really shows.
HOTEL#MISCELLANEOUS 
Prices are competitive especially against the downtown megaprops who charge you for standing still in one spot too long.

Nice little bar and restaurant on site and easy walking distance to trendy bistros (Portland's a really nice hip restaurant is immediately next door.)

Recommend this highly for the seasoned Pheonix road warrior or warriorette.

FACILITIES#MISCELLANEOUS 
Then wait to give order, then wait for the food.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
The food selection was pretty good.
FOOD_DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS 
One time the employee stopped to pick up dirty plates as he led me to my seat!
SERVICE#GENERAL 
The other problem was the hotel manager - a young woman apparently somewhat new at her job.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
She tried to refuse my gold crown club points as payment for my stay.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
When I was persistent, she made a phone call and I heard her say well, i never heard of that.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
Then she credited me for my points.

I would definitely stay here again when in the Phoenix area!
HOTEL#GENERAL

HOTEL#GENERAL 
DO NOT STAY HERE
HOTEL#GENERAL 
My family had 5 rooms at this hotel for one night.

One room was on one floor, 3 were on another, and the last was way up top.

Being way spread out would have been OK until we got to the rooms.

All 4 lower rooms were 80 degrees and above.
ROOMS#COMFORT 
We were assured that the rooms would be cool by the time we got back from our concert.

After the concert we had to change 4 of the rooms twice trying to find cooler floors.
ROOMS#COMFORT 
We finally gave up at 12:30 a.m. with a room that was 77 degrees - still too warm.
ROOMS#COMFORT 
And the room did not even have a shower curtain!
ROOMS#DESIGN_FEATURES 
I understand they are going through renovations, but they need to either do it floor by floor and close that floor or close the entire hotel until finished.
HOTEL#MISCELLANEOUS 
The only nice thing was the free shuttle to America West Arena.
FACILITIES#PRICES 
Very disappointing
HOTEL#GENERAL 
Lots of services promised and not provided.
FACILITIES#GENERAL 
The shuttle wasn't running, and the restaurant was closed down - both of those explained to me with because business is low right now around the holidays.
FACILITIES#GENERAL 
So I guess you should make sure it's going to be busy when you go!

The business center has been taken apart - the front desk staff did not know if it was going to be back, since they had no idea it had been taken apart and were quite shocked to find out, when they tried to let me in to use it.
FACILITIES#GENERAL 
Vending machines were out of everything except in the lobby.
FACILITIES#GENERAL 
Staff was very friendly and a bit embarrassed about everything that wasn't available.
SERVICE#GENERAL

Great hotel, great location, great price
HOTEL#GENERAL 
I had a great time at this hotel and did not experience any of what the bad reviews are about.
HOTEL#GENERAL 
The staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms were large and comfortable, the free breakfast was great, and the location downtown was excellent.
SERVICE#GENERAL 
The free shuttle to and from the airport saved us over 30 dollars alone in taxi cab fare (Phoenix Taxi fares are ridiculously expensive) and is also available anywhere downtown.

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in downtown Phoenix.
